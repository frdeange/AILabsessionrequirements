## Tips for Great Screenshots

1. **Use a clean browser window** - No bookmarks bar, dev tools, or extensions visible
2. **Use the light theme** - Usually more readable in documentation
3. **Capture at 100% zoom** - Ensures text is crisp and readable
4. **Show realistic data** - Use meaningful resource names, not test values
5. **Crop appropriately** - Remove unnecessary browser chrome but keep enough context

## Image Optimization

- **Format:** PNG for screenshots (better quality for text)
- **Compression:** Use tools like TinyPNG to reduce file sizes
- **Alt text:** Already included in the README.md markdown

## Update Instructions
